# Web-Dev-MERN-Journey
This repo is all about how i learn web development using the online resources udemy, freecodecamp.com. 

## "Since I couldn't find any institute that teaches web development in a detailed, structured, and hands-on way, I've decided to take matters into my own hands. This space will be my journey—tracking my activities, resources, practice sessions, projects, and reading materials as I self-study and build my web development skills."
